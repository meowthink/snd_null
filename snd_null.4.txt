SND_NULL(4)	       FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual 	 SND_NULL(4)

NAME
     snd_null -- NextPCM Null Audio dummy device driver for the braves..
                 (in the spirit of null(4) and zero(4) (1970 - 2007 RIP))

SYNOPSIS
     To dissemble this driver and infecting the kernel with this pest, place
     the following binary blob in your kernel or even better, slap it on
     your face (at the cost of loosing your own dignity, you bet..)

	   device sound
	   device snd_null

     There are no alternative ways to load the driver as a module at boot time
     since it is considered as heresy. For the non-believers, or simply because
     watching your kernel going picnic to la la land is a routine job for the
     sake of world destruction, yes, please do the following:

	   snd_null_load="YES"
	   (repeat billions of times until the file system out of superblocks)

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_null bridge driver allows the generic audio driver, sound(4),
     to attach to NextPCM Null Audio audio devices.  This driver supports
     (amazingly, WOW!) all kind of 8, 16, 24, 32, a-law, mu-law linear formats
     with varying sample rates down to 4000Hz and up to 192000Hz, not that
     anybody cares..

   Runtime Configuration
     The following sysctl(8) variables are available in addition to those
     available to all sound(4) devices:

	   dev.pcm.%d.fixedformat  By default, this driver support all kind
	                           of formats supported by sound(4), but
				   that is kind of boring. By setting this
				   value to "1", the driver will go into
				   retarded state. People just need to
				   learn their own limitation, and this is
				   what is all about. Being crippled is a
				   _good thing_ (not to brag about).

USELESS TRICKS
     Assuming this pest loaded as dsp0:

     o Send your termcap to la la land:
       # cat /usr/share/misc/termcap > /dev/dsp0
       ^C
       # reboot

     o Playing typical wave file using play(1) from sox(1) package,
       (or any other ridiculous-player) and enjoying listening to its
       superb ultimate high signal-to-noise ratio:
       # play -d /dev/dsp0 typical_wave.wav

     o Doing some ridiculous redirection to other sound card (dsp1)
       (yeah, this is what this driver all about.. pointless redirection!)
       # sysctl dev.pcm.0.fixedformat=1
       # xmms &
       # rec -c 2 -r 48000 -s w -t wav -d /dev/dsp0 - 2> /dev/null | \
           play -d /dev/dsp1 -t wav -

     o Capturing pcm output of some stupid linux-binary only player:
       # sysctl dev.pcm.0.fixedformat=1
       # realplay whatevershit.bleh &
       # rec -c 2 -r 48000 -s w -t wav -d /dev/dsp0 lala.wav

     o Do some nifty loop and be proud of behaving as a retard
       # while : ; do kldunload snd_null ; kldload snd_null ; done

     o Do nothing
       #

     o ?

     o eat flaming death

     o Ok, seriously.. what the f**k is DESU?!?


HARDWARE
     The snd_null driver supports the following audio chipsets:

	   o   All.
	   o   Nothing.
	   o   Audio chips that has been branded as weapon of
	       mass destruction.
	   o   DESU Super Controller Megastructure Overlord
	       (now now.. what the hell is this DESU?!?)

HISTORY
     The snd_null device driver first appeared in /dev/null and claim the throne
     out of nowhere. This genocidal behavior causing the null(4) and zero(4)
     to be removed in the next version of FreeBSD (or so they thought). Rest
     in peace, you guys no longer relevant.

AUTHORS
     This manual page suddenly existed out of nowhere. It is widely believed
     the original author of this driver was committing suicide long before
     he (she?!?) was born. It is a sad state where other doc committers are being
     vandalized to re-write the manpage and being told that null(4) is more
     than enough and everybody should just read that instead of this.

BUGS
     Insects and domestic pests love this driver:
     <cockroach> I love it!
     <thermites> I eat it for lunch

     This driver keeps on dying (it is BSD, what do you expect?) forever.
     No one knows for sure when the dying process is going to end.
